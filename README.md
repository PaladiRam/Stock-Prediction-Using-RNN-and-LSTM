This project was part of my internship work whichIn this project I attempt to construct a RNN (the LSTM in particular) for predicting stock market returns. The prediction is made on S&P500 index, which is one of the most widely used indices for trading and benchmarking stock market returns.The project goes through following steps:  Data pre-processing and feature scaling, Building RNN, LSTM training and demonstration of results.For demonstration purpose here I have predicted the TATA  company stock price.
